# Encoded Neuroevolution

<img src="Process Diagram.png" width="500"/>

A collection of algorithms, models, encoders, and tests exploring the use of encoding methods in a genetic algorithm that trains neural networks to play Snake.
Finalized optimal model used a modified genetic algorithm on a small FCNN encoded using tensor decomposition. Trained FCNN could successfully play Snake, reaching a score of over 30 before ending the game.

Researched contributed to "Evolutionary Tensor Shape Search for Optimum Data Compression with Tensor Train Decomposition" paper.
