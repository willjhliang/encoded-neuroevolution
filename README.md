# Encoded Neuroevolution

<img src="Process Diagram.png" width="500"/>

A collection of algorithms, models, encoders, and tests exploring the use of encoding methods in a genetic algorithm that trains neural networks to play Snake. Finalized optimal model used a modified genetic algorithm on a small CNN encoded with tensor decomposition. The network successfully plays Snake at superhuman levels, reaching a score of over 30 before ending the game.
